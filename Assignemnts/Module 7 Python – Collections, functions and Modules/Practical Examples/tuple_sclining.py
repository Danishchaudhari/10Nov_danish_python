#Slicing is a powerful technique in Python that allows you to extract a portion of a sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string. The syntax for slicing is as follows:

# my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90)
# print(my_tuple[0:5])
# print(my_tuple[:4])   
# print(my_tuple[5:])   
# print(my_tuple[-5:-2]) 
# print(my_tuple[:])    
# print(my_tuple[::-1]) 
# print(my_tuple[::2]) 

tuple = ('D','A','N','I','S','H')
print(tuple[::-1])


print(tuple[1:6:2])
